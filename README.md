# store-on-the-go


It is a local e-commerce platform for small scale businesses. Seller can sign up very easily can showcase all products. It is based on location/city, so consumer can easily find which products and available in his/her city and where. There is a new payment option available as it is the same city - 'Pay at shop'. In this option consumer has an option to buy/book the product from their homes and pay later at the shop within a duration allowed by the seller. This option may be developed further in future. I will also try to improve the searching algorithms and products loaded per page for better performance.
